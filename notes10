./level10 token 127.0.0.1
You don't have access to token
./level10 level10 127.0.0.1
Connecting to 127.0.0.1:6969 .. Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1

you can listen to a port with nc:
nc -l 6969

this sends the file, we can see some strings. But we already could read that file of course

a bit of disassembly with radare2 (on host computer):
r2 level10
aaa
s sym.main
VV

aaa does the analysis
s sym.main goes to main
VV shows a call graph.

it first checks if there's two arguments, then it checks for an access call
snow_crash only uses known exploits of course :)

man access:
NOTES
       Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example,  open
       a  file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because
       the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the
       file  to manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system call should be
       avoided.  (In the example just described, a safer alternative would be to  tem‚Äê
       porarily  switch  the  process's effective user ID to the real ID and then call
       open(2).)

ok, but I can't really move files around. I can't replace some file by token, because the whole problem is that I don't have read permissions.

so we need a symlink

rm /tmp/link; ln -s /home/user/level10/level10 /tmp/link; ./level10 /tmp/link 127.0.0.1; rm /tmp/link; ln -s /home/user/level10/token /tmp/link


I thought it would help to put in a sleep, but even with a sleep of 0.0000000001 it doesn't seem to work

maybe no sleep but trying often?

scp -p to keep permissions

nc -k flag to keep nc open

it never seems to work in a single script

use ln -f to remove existing, so I don't have to remove it
o

very hard to filter the output

......I wasn't even linking to the token :( maybe it wasn't that hard
