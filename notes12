port 4646 this time

We can't use spaces, and egrep hangs if you don't pass another command. But if you use |, you can run somethings else in parallel

I'm surprized the caps were no problem? I thought I had to make symlinks
ah, I'm using the wrong port and accidentally getting the password for level05

oh no, it's quoted :S. That doesn't work at all! But $() does work

How to run something when you only have caps?

apparently you can do
/*/ls
and it works? If I press tab it expands to /bin/ls
