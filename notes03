a binary
it's owned by flag03
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03  level03 8.5K Mar  5  2016 level03
is that setUID?
strings level03 gives me
/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me
And I can change my env
I don't have permission to edit files in my home, but I can do it in /tmp
if I put an echo there, I can run it by putting /tmp in front of my path
(if I type 'echo' I don't see anything special, because the builtin is used)
so now I can use ./level03 to run something as flag03, like getflag :)
