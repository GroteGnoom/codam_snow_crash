 ./level13
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

in the disassembly we can see it call a getuid and compare it with 0x1092, which is 4242

it also prints out a token with ft_des

That looks like a handmade des algorithm?

maybe I can extract the string directly, and call the ft_des directly? 

I can do anything, so I can just change the value after the getuid call, or change the comparison

(lldb) target create "level13"
Current executable set to '/Users/dnoom/Documents/projects/snow_crash/level13' (i386).
(lldb) run
error: Lost debug server connection

:( I think it's because it's an i386 ..... or maybe because it's not actually executable on a mac...
