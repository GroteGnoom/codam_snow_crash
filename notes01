John the ripper also has these messed up errors:

In file included from argon2_core_plug.c:32:
                                   blake2.h:112:5: error: size of array element is not a multiple of its alignment
                                     112 |     blake2b_state S[4][1];
installed john-the-ripper via snap :(
it did immediately give me the password
