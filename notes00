So there's a flag00 user. 
Its password is not empty.
There's a few dotfiles in the level00 home, but not much else to look at.
'find / ! -user root 2>/dev/null'
there's folders owned by flagxx and group levelxx for level04 and level12
flag00 has a lot of proc files of course
files and folders are also owned by users messagebus, syslog, daemon, whoopsie, www-data, flag11, man, libuuid
when catting /etc/password there's many more users
!! flag01 has its password set there?
in /usr/sbin there's file 'john' of flag00, openarenaserver of flag05
john has encypted password in it
there are of course online caesar cipher checkers:
