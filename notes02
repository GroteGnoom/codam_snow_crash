scp -P 4242 level02@127.0.0.1:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap .

it has silly permissions: ----r--r--
tcpick -C -yP -r level02.pcap
the password is sort of in there, but messed up?
-yP shows non-printable characters as dots 
tcpick -C -yX -r level02.pcap
characters are typed, but then removed with DEL
